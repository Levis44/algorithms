## Complexity Analysis

The process of determining how efficient an algorithm is. Complexity analysis usually involves finding both the **complexity** and the **space complexity** of an algorithm.

Complexity analysis is effectively used to determine how "good" an algorithm is and whether it's "better" than other one.

One Problem can have more than one solution. Sometimes the complexity is the key difference between the quality of solutions. (Space-time complexity) 
## Time Complexity

- How fast an algorithm runs
A measure of how fast an algorithm runs, time complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews. 

Its expressed using [[Big O]] notation
## Space Complexity

- How much memory an algorithm uses
A measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up, space complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews.

Its expressed using [[Big O]] notation
